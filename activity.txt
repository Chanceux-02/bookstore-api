;Input Validation: Validate and sanitize user input to prevent malicious code injection and ensure data integrity.

;Authentication and Authorization: Implement a secure authentication mechanism, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT), to protect sensitive endpoints and ensure only authorized users can access them.

;Password Hashing: Use a strong password-hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or argon2, to securely store user passwords.

;Error Handling: Implement proper error handling and error messages to provide informative responses to clients while safeguarding sensitive information.

;Logging: Implement logging to track and monitor API activities for debugging and auditing purposes.

;HTTPS: Use HTTPS for secure communication by obtaining an SSL certificate and configuring your server to enable secure connections.


;Step 1: User Model and Routes
    Create a User model using Mongoose to represent the user entity, including fields such as username, email, and password. Add any other relevant fields as per your requirements.
    Create routes for user registration, login, and logout in the userController.js file. Implement necessary authentication logic such as validating credentials, generating and verifying tokens (JWT), and managing user sessions.

;Step 2: Password Hashing
    Utilize a password-hashing algorithm like bcrypt or argon2 to securely hash and store user passwords. You can integrate the chosen library into your user registration and login routes.

;Step 3: Protecting Routes
    Implement middleware that verifies the user's authentication status for protected routes. This middleware should check the validity of the provided token (JWT) and grant access to authenticated users only. Otherwise, it should return appropriate error responses.

;Step 4: User Sessions and Tokens
    When a user successfully logs in, generate a unique token (JWT) and include it in the response. This token should be stored on the client-side (e.g., in local storage or as an HTTP-only cookie) and sent with subsequent requests to authenticate the user.
